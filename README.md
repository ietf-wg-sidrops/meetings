# SIDROps Meetings

This repository is used to organize SIDROps sessions in the various IETF meetings. For each IETF meeting there is an IETF-XXX folder. Each folder contains a file named ietf-XXX-sidrops-slot-requests.md with the list of requested slots, for each slot the following information need to be provided:
    
- Title
- Speaker
- Desired duration
- Link to related document in the Datatracker 

Not all requests will be necessarily scheduled in the WG agenda, depending on the priority of the topic and the volume of the demands. The desired duration is just an indication. The allocated time may differ. Requester can either send an email to the chairs and/or secretary or create a Pull Request on the request file.  

The final agenda for each IETF is be prepared by the chairs in the IETF-XXX folder and named ietf-XXX-sidrops-agenda.md. This file is modified by the chairs according to the discussions on the SIDROps mailing list as for the normal IETF process
