# SIDROps Meetings

This repository is used to organize SIDROps sessions in the various IETF meetings. For each IETF meeting there is an IETF-XXX folder. Each folder contains a file named ietf-XXX-sidrops-slot-requests.md with the list of requested slots. To request a slot there are two options:

1.  Create a Pull Request appending to ietf-XXX-sidrops-slot-requests.md the following information:
    
        #### Title Here
        - Speaker: Your Name
        - Desired Duration: in minutes (including Q&A)
        - Datatracker Link:  link to related document(s) in the Datatracker 

2. Send the information above by email to the chairs and/or secretary or create, they will take care to create the Pull Request. 


**Note that:** 
- Not all requests will be necessarily scheduled in the WG agenda, depending on the priority of the topic and the volume of the demands. 
- The desired duration is just an indication. The allocated time may differ. 

The final agenda for each IETF is prepared by the chairs, according to the discussions on the SIDROps mailing list as for the normal IETF process. The final agenda will be created by the chairs in the IETF-XXX folder and named ietf-XXX-sidrops-agenda.md. The final agenda will be also announced on the mailing list and uploaded on the Datatracker, as usual.
