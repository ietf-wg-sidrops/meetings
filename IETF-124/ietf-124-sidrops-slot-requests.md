#### Open Source Tools for RP Testing

- Speaker(s): Jorge Cano / Carlos Martinez
- Desired Duration : 10 min

We would like to briefly present two open source tools the LACNIC team has published in 2025 aimed at providing better support for testing relying party implementations.

##### Barry
https://github.com/LACNIC/barry
A program that converts Repository Descriptors (minimal and mostly JSON-like input) into fully-fledged and maximally-correct RPKI hierarchies (TAL, RPKI certificates, ROAs, CRLs, Manifests and RRDP XMLs), meant for Relying Party testing.
  
##### Rapport
  https://github.com/LACNIC/rapport 
  A black-box test suite that employs Barry to feed (both correct and incorrect) repositories to Relying Parties, and verify their resilience and output.
  Currently, it supports Fort, Routinator, rpki-client and rpki-prover out of the box.
